    "- [X] Updated the model formulation section below to include a constrant that *relaxes* the \"every household needs to be served constraint\" to say, instead, that some percent (percent_served) of the total number of census tracts needs to be served\n",
    "- [X] Added the \"transportation equity\" constraint, that says **IF** a household lives in a census tract that has limited access to transportation, then they can only travel a certain distance (i.e. 2 miles) to get a POD\n",
    "\n",
    "#### To-do:\n",
    "- [ ] Run through all of the sensitivity analysis scenarios\n",
    "- [ ] Update the objective function to include a weighting for household size?"
